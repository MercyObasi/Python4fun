#Global and Local Variable 
"""
Global variable is outside the fxn and the scope is everywhere while local variable is inside the fxn and the scope 
inside the fxn.

A global variable can be accessed inside a fxn

To change a global variable inside a fxn, use "global a"

print("outside:",a)

"""
if you want to create a local variable and still change the global one inside the fxn we use "globals()" and 
since it refers to all the globals variables outside the fxn we use "globals()['a']" to be specific
